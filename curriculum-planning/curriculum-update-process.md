# Updating the FAC Curriculum
**Summer 2017**

Interested alumni have formed a curriculum working group. The first goal of this group is to support the integration of any changes suggested by each of the campuses into the curriculum. 

In order to engage students from all campuses in the process of updating the curriculum, members of this working group will be facilitating individual week-specific teams of current students and alumni (representing all three campuses) who will collaborate to prepare updates to weeks 1-8 of the `master-reference`.

## Week facilitator 

### Role

- Provide a single point of contact for each set of students working on a week
- Provide their team with informed recommendations based on prior experience with the curriculum 
- Communicate their team's recommendations to the curriculum working group
- Communicate a schedule for completion of curriculum updates by the week group
